Suppose someone asked,"Who are you ?" It would be simple enough to respond with your name. But if the person wanted to know the entire story about who you are, the question would be more difficult to answer. You'd obviously have to give the details of your height, age, and weight. You'd also have to include all your **sentiments** and preferences, even the secret ones you've never shared with anyone --- your affection for your loved ones; your desire to please the people you associate with; your dislike of your old sister's husband; your **allegiance** to your favorite **beverage**, brand of clothing,and music.

假设有人问你：你是谁？只回答姓名是足够简单的方式。但是如果这个人想要了解关于你的全部故事，这个问题就变得很难回答了。很明显，你不得不将自己的身高、年龄、体重等细节全部如数告知；你也不得不说出你的情感和喜好，甚至是一些从未向别人分享的秘密---你对情人的爱恋，你想要的取悦于所交往的人的想法，你不喜欢你姐夫；你对你所喜欢的饮料、衣服的品牌和音乐的忠心。

**sentiments：** n 情绪  
 **allegiance：** n. 效忠，忠诚；忠贞  
 **beverage：** n. 饮料  

Your attitudes couldn't be overlooked either--- your impatience when an issue gets complex, your **aversion** to certain courses, your fear of high place and dogs and speaking in public. The list would go on. To be complete, it would have to include all your characteristics---not only the physical but also the emotional and intellectual.

你的态度也不能忽视---你因为一个问题变得复杂而失去耐心；你对某一个学科的厌恶；你的恐高；怕狗以及害怕当中演讲……清单还可以继续列下去。为了更加完善，将不得不包含你的所有特征---不仅是身体方面的，还包括情感和智力方面。

**aversion：** n. 厌恶；讨厌的人

To provide all that information would be quite a **chore**. But suppose the questioner was still curious and asked," How did you get the way you are?" If your patience were not yet exhausted, chances are you'd answer something like this:" I'm this way because I choose to be, because I've considered other sentiments and  preferences and attitudes and have made my selections. The ones I have chosen fit my style and personality best." That answer is natural enough, and in part it's true. But in a larger sense, it's not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than most of us realize.

提供以上所有的信息是一件很让人讨厌的工作。但是假使提问者仍然好奇并且继续问“你是如何成为现在的你的？”如果你的耐心还没有消耗殆尽的话，或许你会像这样回答：“我选择了自己的道路，因为我考虑了其他的情感、喜好及态度，然后作出了我的决定。我的选择与我的特质最匹配，这对我来说是最好的选择。”这个回答很自然，一定程度上也是对的。但是在更高的层面上来看并不正确。这个世界对我们的影响远比我们能感觉到的要大得多。

**chore** n. 家庭杂务；日常的零星事务；**讨厌的或累人的工作**
